    "# Multi-Agent Systems for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce the concept of agents, multi-agent systems and illustrate the potential of such systems in automating data science tasks, such as software development or data analysis. We use [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands) as our agentic software development example. For an example of multi-agent systems for cosmological data analysis, see [cmbagent](https://github.com/CMBagents/cmbagent).\n",
